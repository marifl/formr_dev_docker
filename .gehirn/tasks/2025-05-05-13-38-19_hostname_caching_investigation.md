# Task Checklist: Investigate Hostname and Caching Issues

Investigate application-level configuration and behavior related to domain/hostname and potential caching issues, identifying why the application serves different content or styling based on whether it's accessed via localhost or formr.local.

- [ ] Examine application configuration files for hostname/domain-dependent settings.
- [ ] Look for code that dynamically loads assets or applies styling based on request URL/hostname.
- [ ] Investigate potential application-level caching mechanisms.
- [ ] Check how the application generates URLs for assets based on the accessed domain.
- [ ] Synthesize findings and propose diagnosis.
- [ ] Get user confirmation for diagnosis.
- [ ] (If confirmed) Plan and implement fix.
- [ ] Mark task as complete and archive checklist.
