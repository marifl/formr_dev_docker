# Default User Creation Debugging

## Problem
MySQL client not found in the container during default user creation attempt.

## Debugging Steps
- [x] Modified user creation script to try multiple MySQL client paths
- [x] Added fallback methods for executing MySQL commands
- [x] Improved error handling and logging

## Attempted Solutions
- Tried `/usr/bin/mysql`
- Tried `/opt/mysql/bin/mysql`
- Added fallback to `bash -c "mysql ..."` method

## Potential Root Causes
- Incomplete MySQL client installation in Docker container
- Non-standard MySQL client path
- Container configuration issue

## Recommended Next Steps
- [ ] Verify MySQL client is installed in formr_db container
- [ ] Check container's filesystem to locate correct MySQL client path
- [ ] Confirm database container is running correctly
- [ ] Manually test MySQL connection inside the container

## Diagnostic Information
- Error: "OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: 'mysql': executable file not found in $PATH"
- Attempted multiple methods to execute MySQL command
- Fallback methods did not resolve the issue

## Potential Workarounds
- Modify Dockerfile to ensure MySQL client is installed
- Use alternative method for user creation (e.g., PHP script, direct database initialization)
