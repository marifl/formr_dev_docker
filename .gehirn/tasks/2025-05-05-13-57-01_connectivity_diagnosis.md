# Task: Diagnose Application Connectivity Issue

**Problem:** The application is not reachable via HTTP/HTTPS, using `localhost` or `formr.local`.

**Initial Information:**
- Changes were made to Apache configuration.
- Docker containers are running, but logs show errors.
- Reviewed `docker-compose.yml`, `formr_app/apache/sites-enabled/formr.conf`, `formr_app/apache/sites-enabled/formr-ssl.conf`, and `coredns/zones/formr.local.db`.
- Received `formr_app` Docker logs.

**Potential Causes:**
- Errors in Apache configuration files (`formr.conf`, `formr-ssl.conf`).
- Issues with Docker container networking or port mappings.
- Problems with DNS resolution for `formr.local`.
- Host machine firewall or network configuration issues.

- [ ] **Analyze Docker Logs:** Examine the provided `formr_app` Docker logs for specific error messages related to Apache, PHP, or networking. Identify the timestamps and nature of the errors.
- [ ] **Review Apache Configurations:**
    - [ ] Check `formr_app/apache/sites-enabled/formr.conf` for syntax errors, incorrect `DocumentRoot` or `Directory` paths, and issues with the HTTP to HTTPS rewrite rule.
    - [ ] Check `formr_app/apache/sites-enabled/formr-ssl.conf` for syntax errors, incorrect `DocumentRoot` or `Directory` paths (noted potential issue on lines 4 and 11), and correct SSL certificate/key paths.
    - [ ] Ensure there are no conflicting `VirtualHost` definitions or duplicate `Listen` directives if not handled by Docker.
- [ ] **Verify Docker Compose Configuration:**
    - [ ] Confirm that the `formr_app` service in `docker-compose.yml` has the correct port mappings (80:80 and 443:443).
    - [ ] Check that the `formr_app` service is connected to the expected network (`all`).
- [ ] **Examine CoreDNS Configuration:**
    - [ ] Review `coredns/zones/formr.local.db` to ensure `formr.local` and `*.formr.local` are correctly pointing to `127.0.0.1`.
    - [ ] (Requires execution) Verify that the CoreDNS container is running and healthy.
    - [ ] (Requires execution) Test DNS resolution for `formr.local` from within the `formr_app` container and from the host machine.
- [ ] **Check Host Machine Network:**
    - [ ] (Requires execution) Check the host machine's firewall to ensure ports 80 and 443 are open and not blocked.
    - [ ] (Requires execution) Verify the host machine's `/etc/hosts` file does not have conflicting entries for `formr.local` or `localhost`.
    - [ ] (Requires execution) Confirm the host machine's DNS resolver is correctly configured to use the CoreDNS server provided by the Docker setup.
- [ ] **Propose Solutions:** Based on the findings from the above steps, identify the root cause and propose specific actions to rectify the configuration or environment issue. This may involve correcting Apache configuration files, adjusting Docker settings, or modifying host network configurations.

**Next Steps:**

Once this plan is approved, I will need to switch to a mode capable of executing commands (like Debug or Code mode) to perform the checks and apply the necessary fixes.
